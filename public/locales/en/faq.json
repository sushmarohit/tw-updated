    {
      "category": "process",
      "question": "How do I know this will work for my business?",
      "answer": "Every engagement starts with diagnostics using our G2P framework and cost leakage tools. You'll see the specific gaps and opportunities before committing to anything beyond the assessment."
    },
    {
      "category": "process",
      "question": "Can you help pinpoint my exact challenges before we start?",
      "answer": "Yes! Book a discovery call. We'll ask targeted questions and give you initial insights. No paywall to clarity."
    },
    {
      "category": "process",
      "question": "How quickly can I see measurable results?",
      "answer": "Early wins appear within 30–60 days of implementation. Full transformation typically shows up in the first 90 days."
    },
    {
      "category": "process",
      "question": "Will my team be able to sustain these improvements after engagement?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. We embed governance loops and train your team to operate independently. The goal is a self-correcting system that improves without us."
    },
    {
      "category": "process",
      "question": "What's your success rate?",
      "answer": "12+ case studies show 35–59% governance improvements and ₹45–90L annual cost savings. Your specific outcome depends on your starting point and commitment to implementation."
    },
    {
      "category": "tools",
      "question": "Is my data secure when I use your calculators?",
      "answer": "Yes, encrypted and never shared. Data is deleted after 90 days unless you request follow-up."
    },
    {
      "category": "tools",
      "question": "Do you contact me after I use a tool?",
      "answer": "Only if you request a callback or book a discovery call. No unsolicited sales."
    },
    {
      "category": "tools",
      "question": "Can I use tools multiple times?",
      "answer": "Absolutely—track progress over time."
    },
    {
      "category": "tools",
      "question": "How accurate are the calculator results?",
      "answer": "Built on TwelfthKey's industry benchmarks and G2P framework. Your report includes context and next-step recommendations."
    },
    {
      "category": "tools",
      "question": "Are the tools really free?",
      "answer": "Yes. All 8 diagnostics and calculators are free to use. We offer a detailed PDF report and optional discovery call to discuss results."
    },
    {
      "category": "services",
      "question": "What's the difference between Assessment and Foundation?",
      "answer": "Assessment is a 5–7 day deep-dive that delivers a prioritised roadmap and ROI projection. Foundation is the 60-day implementation that builds SOPs, workflows, and dashboards based on that roadmap."
    },
    {
      "category": "services",
      "question": "Do you work with startups only, or also established MSMEs?",
      "answer": "Both. We work with companies in the 5–100 Cr revenue range, typically with 3+ years of operating history—from scaling startups to established MSMEs."
    },
    {
      "category": "services",
      "question": "What industries do you serve?",
      "answer": "Banking, FinTech, SaaS, IT Services, Telecom, Healthcare, E-commerce, and Professional Services. Our G2P framework adapts to service-based operations across sectors."
    },
    {
      "category": "services",
      "question": "Is the engagement remote or on-site?",
      "answer": "Discovery and most design work are virtual. Implementation can include on-site workshops and training where needed; we tailor to your preference."
    },
    {
      "category": "services",
      "question": "What if we're not ready for a full engagement?",
      "answer": "Start with a discovery call or a Business Operational Assessment. There's no obligation beyond the assessment—you decide the next step with full clarity."
    },
    {
      "category": "praxio",
      "question": "What is PraXio™?",
      "answer": "PraXio™ is TwelfthKey's governance and operations platform: real-time dashboards, automated reporting, and AI anomaly detection—all in one app for our clients."
    },
    {
      "category": "praxio",
      "question": "Do I need PraXio™ to work with TwelfthKey?",
      "answer": "It depends on the engagement. Assessment and some Foundation work can be done without it; Governance Intelligence and ongoing fractional CBO typically use PraXio™ for dashboards and reporting."

      "category": "praxio",
      "question": "Can PraXio™ connect to our existing tools?",
      "answer": "Yes. PraXio™ integrates with HRMS, CRM, ERP, and common productivity tools. We'll map your stack during onboarding."

    {
      "category": "pricing",
      "question": "Why don't you publish timeline and budget on the website?",
      "answer": "Every engagement is scoped after a diagnostic. We provide a clear proposal with deliverables and investment after understanding your context—no one-size-fits-all pricing."
    },
    {
      "category": "pricing",
      "question": "What does the Assessment cost?",
      "answer": "The Business Operational Assessment is ₹1,49,999 (one-time, 5–7 days). Typical ROI identified is ₹40–60L in recoverable leakage."
    },
    {
      "category": "pricing",
      "question": "Do you offer payment plans?",

    },
    {
      "category": "fractional",
      "question": "How is Fractional CBO different from a consultant?",
      "answer": "A fractional CBO is an on-demand executive: hands-on execution, mentorship, and strategic oversight—not just advice. You get 8–12 hours/week of leadership without full-time cost."
    },
    {
      "category": "fractional",
      "question": "What's the typical commitment for Fractional CBO?",
      "answer": "Minimum 6-month retainer. Investment is ₹1,99,999/month for 8–12 hours/week, scalable for execution phases."
    },
    {
      "category": "fractional",
      "question": "How much do we save vs. a full-time CXO?",
      "answer": "Typically 65–80% cost savings compared to a full-time hire, with no long-term commitment and immediate access to senior expertise."
    },
    {
      "category": "fractional",
      "question": "Can we scale hours up or down?",
      "answer": "Yes. Hours can be scaled based on business needs—e.g. more during implementation, less during steady state."
    },
    {
      "category": "security",
      "question": "How do you handle our data?",
      "answer": "We follow GDPR-aligned practices, encrypt data in transit and at rest, and describe collection and use in our Privacy Policy. We can sign Data Processing Agreements where required."
    },
    {
      "category": "security",
      "question": "Are you PCI-DSS compliant?",
      "answer": "We are PCI-DSS ready for payment processing. For card data we use compliant gateways; we do not store card details on our systems."
    },
    {
      "category": "security",
      "question": "Do you support audit and compliance evidence?",
      "answer": "Yes. PraXio™ and our processes support audit trails and evidence collection for governance and compliance reviews."
    },
    {
      "category": "gettingStarted",
      "question": "What's the first step?",
      "answer": "Book a 45-minute discovery call. We'll discuss your context, pain points, and fit—no obligation. You can also run a free Operational Health Diagnostic first."
    },
    {
      "category": "gettingStarted",
      "question": "No credit card required?",
      "answer": "Correct. Discovery calls and free tools require no credit card. You only enter payment when you sign an engagement."
    },
    {
      "category": "gettingStarted",
      "question": "Will I get sales pressure?",
      "answer": "No. Our goal is clarity. We'll recommend next steps only when they fit your situation—no high-pressure tactics."
    },
    {
      "category": "gettingStarted",
      "question": "Can I talk to someone before booking?",
      "answer": "Yes. Use the contact form, live chat (when available), or email. We respond within 1–2 business days."
