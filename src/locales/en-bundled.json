You'll see the specific gaps and opportunities before committing to anything beyond the assessment."},{"category":"process","question":"Can you help pinpoint my exact challenges before we start?","answer":"Yes! Book a discovery call. We'll ask targeted questions and give you initial insights. No paywall to clarity."},{"category":"process","question":"How quickly can I see measurable results?","answer":"Early wins appear within 30–60 days of implementation. Full transformation typically shows up in the first 90 days."},{"category":"process","question":"Will my team be able to sustain these improvements after engagement?","answer":"Absolutely. We embed governance loops and train your team to operate independently. The goal is a self-correcting system that improves without us."},{"category":"process","question":"What's your success rate?","answer":"12+ case studies show 35–59% governance improvements and ₹45–90L annual cost savings. Your specific outcome depends on your starting point and commitment to implementation."},{"category":"tools","question":"Is my data secure when I use your calculators?","answer":"Yes, encrypted and never shared. Data is deleted after 90 days unless you request follow-up."},{"category":"tools","question":"Do you contact me after I use a tool?","answer":"Only if you request a callback or book a discovery call. No unsolicited sales."},{"category":"tools","question":"Can I use tools multiple times?","answer":"Absolutely—track progress over time."},{"category":"tools","question":"How accurate are the calculator results?","answer":"Built on TwelfthKey's industry benchmarks and G2P framework. Your report includes context and next-step recommendations."},{"category":"tools","question":"Are the tools really free?","answer":"Yes. All 8 diagnostics and calculators are free to use. We offer a detailed PDF report and optional discovery call to discuss results."},{"category":"services","question":"What's the difference between Assessment and Foundation?","answer":"Assessment is a 5–7 day deep-dive that delivers a prioritised roadmap and ROI projection. Foundation is the 60-day implementation that builds SOPs, workflows, and dashboards based on that roadmap."},{"category":"services","question":"Do you work with startups only, or also established MSMEs?","answer":"Both. We work with companies in the 5–100 Cr revenue range, typically with 3+ years of operating history—from scaling startups to established MSMEs."},{"category":"services","question":"What industries do you serve?","answer":"Banking, FinTech, SaaS, IT Services, Telecom, Healthcare, E-commerce, and Professional Services. Our G2P framework adapts to service-based operations across sectors."},{"category":"services","question":"Is the engagement remote or on-site?","answer":"Discovery and most design work are virtual. Implementation can include on-site workshops and training where needed; we tailor to your preference."},{"category":"services","question":"What if we're not ready for a full engagement?","answer":"Start with a discovery call or a Business Operational Assessment. There's no obligation beyond the assessment—you decide the next step with full clarity."},{"category":"praxio","question":"What is PraXio™?","answer":"PraXio™ is TwelfthKey's governance and operations platform: real-time dashboards, automated reporting, and AI anomaly detection—all in one app for our clients."},{"category":"praxio","question":"Do I need PraXio™ to work with TwelfthKey?","answer":"It depends on the engagement. Assessment and some Foundation work can be done without it; Governance Intelligence and ongoing fractional CBO typically use PraXio™ for dashboards and reporting."},{"category":"praxio","question":"Can PraXio™ connect to our existing tools?","answer":"Yes. PraXio™ integrates with HRMS, CRM, ERP, and common productivity tools. We'll map your stack during onboarding."},{"category":"praxio","question":"Is there a free trial?","answer":"Yes. We offer a 14-day free trial with full access. Request a demo or start a trial from the PraXio™ demo page."},{"category":"pricing","question":"Why don't you publish timeline and budget on the website?","answer":"Every engagement is scoped after a diagnostic. We provide a clear proposal with deliverables and investment after understanding your context—no one-size-fits-all pricing."},{"category":"pricing","question":"What does the Assessment cost?","answer":"The Business Operational Assessment is ₹1,49,999 (one-time, 5–7 days). Typical ROI identified is ₹40–60L in recoverable leakage."},{"category":"pricing","question":"Do you offer payment plans?","answer":"For larger engagements we can discuss phased payment aligned to milestones. Details are in the proposal."},{"category":"pricing","question":"Is there a money-back guarantee?","answer":"For one-time services, we offer a 100% refund within 30 days if the engagement has not been initiated. See our Refund Policy for full terms."},{"category":"fractional","question":"How is Fractional CBO different from a consultant?","answer":"A fractional CBO is an on-demand executive: hands-on execution, mentorship, and strategic oversight—not just advice. You get 8–12 hours/week of leadership without full-time cost."},{"category":"fractional","question":"What's the typical commitment for Fractional CBO?","answer":"Minimum 6-month retainer. Investment is ₹1,99,999/month for 8–12 hours/week, scalable for execution phases."},{"category":"fractional","question":"How much do we save vs. a full-time CXO?","answer":"Typically 65–80% cost savings compared to a full-time hire, with no long-term commitment and immediate access to senior expertise."},{"category":"fractional","question":"Can we scale hours up or down?","answer":"Yes. Hours can be scaled based on business needs—e.g. more during implementation, less during steady state."},{"category":"security","question":"How do you handle our data?","answer":"We follow GDPR-aligned practices, encrypt data in transit and at rest, and describe collection and use in our Privacy Policy. We can sign Data Processing Agreements where required."},{"category":"security","question":"Are you PCI-DSS compliant?","answer":"We are PCI-DSS ready for payment processing. For card data we use compliant gateways; we do not store card details on our systems."},{"category":"security","question":"Do you support audit and compliance evidence?","answer":"Yes. PraXio™ and our processes support audit trails and evidence collection for governance and compliance reviews."},{"category":"gettingStarted","question":"What's the first step?","answer":"Book a 45-minute discovery call. We'll discuss your context, pain points, and fit—no obligation. You can also run a free Operational Health Diagnostic first."},{"category":"gettingStarted","question":"No credit card required?","answer":"Correct. Discovery calls and free tools require no credit card. You only enter payment when you sign an engagement."},{"category":"gettingStarted","question":"Will I get sales pressure?","answer":"No. Our goal is clarity. We'll recommend next steps only when they fit your situation—no high-pressure tactics."},{"category":"gettingStarted","question":"Can I talk to someone before booking?","answer":"Yes. Use the contact form, live chat (when available), or email. We respond within 1–2 business days."}],"stillHaveQuestions":"Still have questions?","contactPrompt":"Book a discovery call or reach out—we're happy to help."},"footer":{"tagline":"Win the Operations Game.","proprietary":"Proprietary to TwelfthKey Consulting.","quickLinks":"Quick Links","legalCompliance":"Legal & Compliance","copyright":"© 2026 TwelfthKey Consulting.
